# Tech Engineer Salary Prediction Model

This project has been undertaken with the primary objective of deepening understanding of predictive models and experiencing the full process using real uncleaned data.

## Project Overview

As part of this project, we explore and implement advanced techniques in data science to predict the salary of an engineer working in tech based on Stack Overflow's annual developer survey which contains 70,000+ instances, and 60 columns. The project's focus on data cleaning ensures the reliability and quality of the dataset, laying a robust foundation for subsequent analysis. Leveraging the capabilities of the `scikit-learn` library, we craft sophisticated predictive models capable of providing accurate insights into salary predictions.

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning:** Data cleaning techniques have been employed to ensure the dataset's integrity, leading to more reliable predictions.

- **Predictive Models:** Using `scikit-learn` library, this project delves into the development of a K-Nearest Neighbors model to forecast a tech engineer's salaries. This involves the implementation of cutting-edge algorithms to extract meaningful patterns from the data.

- **Data Visualization:** The use of `seaborn` for data visualization adds a layer of clarity and interpretation to the findings. Visual representations enhance our ability to communicate complex insights derived from the analysis.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into clear and modular sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of the data science pipeline. This includes dedicated sections for data cleaning, model development, and data visualization, providing a comprehensive overview of the entire process.
